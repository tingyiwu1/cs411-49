## Idea 1: mood predictor
The app will fetch the user’s recently played tracks (spotify api) and determine their recent mood by prompting an LLM (openai api) with processed data from the playlist. Users will be able to log in, import their playlist, and get an overview of how the website thinks they’re feeling.

## Idea 2: travel planner
The app will have inputs for various user preferences and help them curate an itinerary. We can use APIs like Tripadvisor or aviationstack as well as tomorrow.io to generate suggestions for places to go and things to do.
